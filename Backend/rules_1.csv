"Significant expenditure incurred with the object of acquiring tangible assets of a permanent nature (for use in the organisation and not for sale in the ordinary course of business) or enhancing the utility of existing assets, shall broadly be defined as Capital expenditure."

"Only the cost of genuine improvements, which enhance the useful life of the asset whether determined by prescribed rules or formulae, or under special orders of Government, may be debited to Capital."
"Where under special orders of Government, a Depreciation or Renewals Reserve Fund is established for renewing assets of any commercial department or undertaking, the distribution of expenditure on renewals and replacements between Capital and the Fund shall be so regulated as to guard against overcapitalisation on the one hand and excessive withdrawals from the Fund on the other."

The Central Government (which includes Union Territories) and the State Governments have agreed under reciprocal arrangements not to prefer petty and isolated claims for an amount not exceeding Rupees ten thousand against one another Rule 112 Criteria in determining whether a particular claim is covered by the reciprocal arrangement.
"The significant criterion in determining whether a particular claim is covered by the reciprocal arrangement mentioned above, will be that the claim shall be both petty and of an occasional character and shall cover services rendered and not supplies made unless the latter forms part of service."
"The term “service rendered” will be taken to mean an individual act of service, like providing police escort to a high dignitary and will not apply to supply of stores etc."
"Claims relating to Commercial undertakings under the Government of India or the State Governments such as those of the Railways, the Department of Post, the Electrical undertakings, etc., shall fall outside the purview of the proposed reciprocal arrangements and shall continue to be settled as hitherto."

"Note: In the converse case relating to the entrustment of a State function to the Central Government under Article258-A of the Constitution, a procedure similar to that indicated in the Rule 116 above shall be followed."
"The extra cost on staff and other contingent expenditure, etc., will accordingly have to be provided in the Budget of the Central Government in the usual manner and recovery made in lumpsum from the State Government concerned."
The other expenditure on execution of the work proper should be debited to the State Government concerned directly and the question of obtaining a vote of the Parliament for the same will not arise.
Inter- Governmental adjustments can be carried out upto the 15th of April on which date the years contract shall be offered to the State Government during which the Central Government would pay the fixed sum per annum for the work.
The amount will be subjected to review at the end of each period of five years.

"The cardinal principle  governing  the assessment  of  responsibility  is that, every Government  officer should exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure from public fund generally as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of the expenditure and the custody of his own money."
"While, the competent authority may, in special cases, condone an officer's honest errors of judgement involving financial loss if the officer can show that he has acted in good faith and done his best up to the limits of his ability and experience, personal liability shall be strictly enforced against all officers who are dishonest, careless or negligent in the duties entrusted to them."
"In cases where loss is due to delinquencies of subordinate officials and where it appears that this has been facilitated by laxity of supervision on the part of a superior officer, the latter shall also be called strictly to account and his personal liability in the matter carefully assessed."
(a) The question of enforcing pecuniary liability shall always be considered as well as the question of other forms of disciplinary action.
"In deciding the degree of an officer's pecuniary liability, it will be necessary to look not only to the circumstances of the case but also to the financial circumstances of the officer, since it should be recognized that the penalty should not be such as to impair his future efficiency."
"(b) In particular if the loss has occurred through fraud, every endeavour should be made to recover  the whole amount lost from the guilty persons and if laxity of supervision has facilitated the fraud, the supervising officer at fault may properly be penalized either directly by requiring him to make good in money a sufficient proportion of the loss or indirectly by reduction or stoppage of his increments of pay."
"(c) It  should  always  be  considered  whether  the  depreciated  value  of  the  Government  property  or equipment lost, damaged or destroyed by the carelessness of individuals entrusted with their care should be  recovered  from  the  delinquent  official."
"The depreciated value  of  the  stores  may  be calculated by applying the 20% of depreciation in the case of vehicles, including cycles, and 15% in the case of calculating machines, on the reduced balance every year."
The amount to be recovered may be limited to the Government servant's capacity to pay.
"When a pensionable Government servant is concerned in any irregularity or loss, the authority investigating the case shall bear in mind the provisions contained in Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1972 as amended from time to time and immediately inform the Audit Officer and/or the Accounts Officer, as the case may be, responsible for reporting on his title to Pension or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity, and the authority competent to sanction Pension or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity and it will be the duty of the latter to make a  note of the information and see that the Gratuity or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity is not paid before a conclusion is arrived at as regards the Government servant's culpability and final orders are issued thereon."
"The fact that Government servants who were guilty of frauds or irregularities have been demobilized or have retired and have thus escaped punishment, should not be made a justification for absolving those who are also guilty but who still remain in service."
"It is of the greatest importance to avoid delay in the investigation of any loss due to fraud, negligence, financial irregularity, etc."
"Should the administrative authority require the assistance of the Audit Officer and/or the Accounts Officer, as the case may be, in pursuing the investigation, he may call on that officer for all vouchers and other documents that may be relevant to the investigation; and if the investigation is complex and he needs the assistance of an expert Audit Officer/ Accounts Officer to unravel it, he should apply forthwith for that assistance to Government which will then negotiate with Audit Officer and/or the Accounts Officer concerned for the services of an investigating staff."
"Thereafter, the administrative authority and the Audit /Accounts authority shall be personally responsible within their respective spheres, for the expeditious conduct of the enquiry."
"In any case in which it appears that recourse to judicial proceedings is likely, the Special Police Establishment or the State Police should be associated with the investigation."
"Depending upon the results of the inquiry, departmental proceedings and/or prosecution shall be instituted at the earliest moment against the delinquent officials concerned and conducted with strict adherence to the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957, and other instructions prescribed in this regard by Government."

(2) Estimates of revenue receipts of the Union Territory Administrations will be furnished to the Ministry of Finance by the concerned Audit Officer / Accounts Officer wherever departmentalization of accounts has not taken place and by the Controller of Accounts of the Union Territory Administrations where departmentalization of accounts has been introduced.
(3) Estimates of receipts in all other cases will be prepared by Controller of Accounts of each Department after obtaining necessary data by the 30th November from the various organizations / field units and such scrutiny as may be necessary in the light of policy decisions and other post Budget developments.
"Estimates will be furnished to the Ministry of Finance in prescribed forms (GFR 2, 2-A and 2-B) by the prescribed date, each year for the ensuing Budget."
"(1) In preparing the Revised Estimates, while previous year's actuals and current year's trends will be material factors to review the original Budget Estimates, special attention should be devoted to making as realistic an estimate as possible of receipts which are likely to materialize during the rest of the financial year."
"(2) In framing the Budget Estimates for the ensuing year, the estimating authorities should exercise utmost care."
"While all receipts which can be foreseen in the light of latest trends, decisions and developments must be provided for, care should be taken to ensure that undue optimism does not influence these estimates."
"Similarly, where the receipts have a seasonal character, due note should be taken thereof in preparing the estimates."
"(4) Estimates of receipts by way of interest on loans and advances will be based on the terms of the loans sanctioned, as entered in the Loan Registers, including defaults, if any."
"The estimates should be realistic; that is to say, that the estimates should reflect not merely what is due but what is likely to be realized during the year together with the reasons for non-recovery of the difference between receipts due and assumed in the estimates."
"In the case of Public Sector Units, interest receipts expected from their internal resources should be distinguished from notional recoveries offset by corresponding expenditure provisions in the form of subsidies and loans."
"Similarly, where repayments due are refinanced by further loans or by conversion of past loans into equity, the details should be furnished."
"(5) In reporting estimates of receipts by way of foreign grant assistance in cash or in kind, care should be taken to classify foreign grant receipts in cash under the Major Head '1605 External Grant Assistance' and those in the form of commodities under the Major Head '1606 Aid Materials and Equipment'."
"In the case of commodities grants, identical provision will be made in expenditure estimates under the Major head '3606 Aid Materials and"
Ministry of Finance Department of Expenditure
"104 Equipment's' (both as debits to represent the notional payment therefor and as credits - recoveries in reductions of expenditure - to reflect the counter-balancing entries), as well as under the final functional Head of Account showing the final destination and use of the aid materials and equipment."
"For utilization of cash grants, provision in expenditure estimates under the final functional Heads of Account will be necessary."
"(6) In reporting the estimates, the estimating authorities should confine their estimates to those items of receipts which are to be accounted for finally in their own accounts and ultimately in the accounts of the Ministry/ Department to which they are subordinate."
"All other receipts/recoveries entering the accounts of another Ministry/ Department should be communicated to the concerned Ministry/Department for consolidation in their estimates (e.g., receipts of CGHS contributions and rent recoveries in respect of Government accommodation)."
Ministry of Finance Department of Expenditure
"For purpose of Budget Estimates, expenditure from the Consolidated Fund –with the merger of Plan and Non- Plan from Budget 2017-18 will comprise of expenditure on revenue account and on capital account including loans and advances, and shown in the separate categories as applicable, comprising of I."
"To facilitate appropriate  scrutiny and consolidation of  Expenditure  Estimates for reporting  to the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Adviser in each Ministry / Department will obtain detailed estimates and other supporting data from each of the estimating authorities under the control of the Ministry / Department, in appropriate forms, sufficiently in advance."
The framing of the Revised Estimates for the current year should always precede estimation for the ensuing year.
"The Revised Estimates should be framed with great care to include only those items which are likely to materialize for payment during the current year, in the light of (i) actuals so far recorded during the current year, compared with the actuals for corresponding period of the last and previous years, (ii) seasonal character or otherwise  of  the  nature  of  expenditure,  (iii)  sanctions  for  expenditure  and  orders  of  appropriation  or re- appropriation already issued or contemplated and (iv) any other relevant factor, decision or development."
"The Budget Estimate for the ensuing year should likewise be prepared on the basis of what is expected to be paid, under proper sanction, during the ensuring year, including arrears of previous years, if any."
"Due attention to considerations of economy must be paid and while all inescapable and foreseeable expenditures should be provided for, care should be taken that the estimate is not influenced by undue optimism."
No lump sum provision will be made in the Budget except where urgent measures are to be provided for meeting emergent situations or for meeting preliminary expenses on a project/scheme which has been accepted in principle for being taken up in the financial year.
"In latter cases Budget provision will be limited to the requirements of preliminary expenses and for such initial outlay, as, for example, on collection of material, recruitment of skeleton staff, etc."
Provision for a 'token' demand should not be made in the Budget Estimates for the purpose of seeking approval in principle for big schemes without the full financial implications being worked out and got approved by the appropriate authorities.
"In accordance with instructions contained in Paragraph (viii) of Appendix (5), a 'token' demand can be made during the course of a year for a project / scheme when the details thereof are ready and funds are also available for undertaking it but it cannot be started without Parliament's approval, it being in the nature of a 'New Service/New Instrument of Services'."
"All estimates should be prepared on gross basis and 'voted' and 'charged' portions must be shown separately; even expenditure met partly or fully from receipts taken in reduction of such expenditure or those counterbalanced by receipts credited as revenue to the Consolidated Fund, must be reported in such estimates on gross basis."
"Care should also be taken to ensure that all notional receipts reported in 'Receipt Estimates' (such as interest receipts fully or partly subsidized, loan repayment receipts partly or fully refinanced through further loans or conversions into equity, receipts of foreign grant assistance in the form of commodities or material, etc.)"
"The estimates of expenditure should include all items which are fully accounted for in the accounts of the Ministry/Departments to which the estimating authority is subordinate; they shall also cover expenditure, if any, in Union Territories without Legislature, whether provided for in the demands of the said Ministry / Department or in the 'Area' demand of the concerned Union Territory."
"Estimates of 'Works Expenditure', if any, against the provisions in the demands of the Ministry of Urban Development, as well as expenditure on pensions (including commutation payments, gratuity payments, pension contributions, etc.)"
Ministry of Finance Department of Expenditure
"106 to Government servants, etc., which are provided for in the centralized Grants/Appropriations controlled by the Ministry of Finance should be furnished to the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance."
"The estimate of establishment charges should be framed taking into account the trends over preceding three years and other relevant factors like changes in rates of pay, allowances, number of posts and their filling and the economy instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time."
The correctness of accounts classification must be ensured by the Principal Chief Controller / Chief Controller/ Controller of Accounts in each case.
"Doubts, if any, may be clarified beforehand in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, Budget Division and Controller General of Accounts."
The relevant Grant number and title of Appropriation should also be mentioned to facilitate identification of the provision in Budget Estimates for the current year.
"Unless otherwise indicated by the Ministry of Finance, estimates (both Revised Estimates for the current year and Budget Estimates for the ensuing year) should reach the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, Budget Division, by the date prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, each year, in triplicate in Form GFR 4, a separate form being used for each Major Head of Account."
"To facilitate appreciation and scrutiny of the estimates, any major variations between the Budget and Revised Estimates for the current year and also between the Revised Estimates for the current year and Budget Estimates for the ensuing year should be explained cogently."
"In particular, all provisions for subsidy, capital investment or loan to a Public Sector Undertaking, must be explained by indicating their purpose and the extent to which they are intended to cover losses, working capital needs, debt or interest liabilities of the undertaking."
"Wherever the proposed estimates attract the limitations of 'New Service/New Instrument of Service', the fact must be specifically highlighted."
The guidelines to be followed in this regard are indicated in Annexure - I to this Appendix.
"For all 'new' schemes, other than purely 'works' projects, the estimates proposed should be supported by details set out in Annexure - II to this Appendix."
"In the case of provisions of 'Grants-in-aid' to non- Government entities, the full purpose thereof and the nature of the grants, whether recurring or non-recurring, should also be indicated."
"All provisions for transfer of Government assets to Public Sector Undertaking and other non-Government entities must  also  be  highlighted,  indicating  whether  the transfer is by way  of  grants or by way  of  equity investment or loan."
"Similarly, in the case of nationalization or take-over of any private sector assets, the related provisions in estimates must be supported by full details, such as the effective date of take-over, the agreed compensation amount and the manner of its payment, etc."
"In cases of takeover, where the assets are simultaneously transferred to a Public Sector Undertaking, it must be ensured that the estimates provide for (i) payment of compensation for the take-over, (ii) for transfer of assets to the Public Sector Undertaking, by means of recovery of compensation payment to be taken in reduction of expenditure, and (iii) provisions for equity or loan to the Public Sector Undertaking."
"The Budget Division through the yearly Budget Circular will prescribe the form and the manner in which proposals are required to be submitted to them for determining the scheme allocations,(both Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes) for the ensuing year."
"The Financial Adviser in each Ministry / Department of the Central Government will accordingly call for requisite data from the estimating authorities, public sector and other enterprises under the control of the Ministry / Department, etc."
The approved allocations for Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes will be communicated by the Ministry of Finance to the
Ministry of Finance Department of Expenditure
"Ministries/ Departments will finalize the Statement of Budget Estimates, indicating the total outlay approved for each scheme / organization and the extent to which it is to be met from extra-budget resources and from provisions in the Demands for Grants."
"Subject to such directions as may be issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time, the Revised Estimates for the current year and Budget Estimates of the ensuing year, in respect of Scheme provisions, are to be sent to the Ministry of Finance in Form GFR 7."
"For furnishing these estimates, instructions for preparation and submission of Other than scheme Expenditure Estimates will apply to the extent relevant; in addition, the following points should also be borne in mind :- (i) Such part of the approved budgetary support for Scheme outlay as relates to 'works expenditure' and has been accepted by the Ministry of Urban Development for inclusion in their Demands for Grants should be excluded by the other Ministries / Departments in reporting the estimates to the Ministry of Finance in Form GFR 4."
"(ii) In the case of, provisions for equity investments  and loans to public sector and other enterprises,  as well as those for grants-in-aid,  specific schemes,  for which the outlay is provided  and the extent for each of them is also to be indicated clearly."
"(iii) Provisions  for Scheme  expenditure  on Central  Sector Schemes  and Centrally  Sponsored  Schemes, including such expenditures in Union Territories,  are to be included in the relevant demand of the Administrative  Ministry/ Department and not in 'Area' Demand of the concerned Union Territory."

An excess over the sanctioned Grant or Appropriation may arise owing to either – (a) an unforeseen emergency; or (b) under-estimated or insufficient allowance for factors leading to the growth of expenditure.
"In the case of an excess of either type the Head of the Department or the Controlling Officer concerned should proceed as follows :- (i) He should, in the first place, examine the allotments given to other Disbursing Officers under the same detailed head within the unit of appropriation, and transfer to the Disbursing Officer who requires an additional allotment such sum as can be permanently or temporarily spared."
"Since appropriation audit is ordinarily conducted against total allotments for a unit, reappropriation in the technical sense of the word is not involved in such cases."
The process amounts only to redistribution which the Controlling Officer can ordinarily effect without reference to any other authority.
"(ii)  Should he find such redistribution impossible he should examine the allotments against other detailed heads inside the primary units of appropriation, with the object of discovering probable savings and effecting a transfer."
"Otherwise, he should obtain the sanction of the competent authority."
"(iii) If the provision of funds from within the primary units proves to be impossible, an examination of the whole grant should be undertaken to see whether there are likely to be savings under any of the other units of grant or appropriation which can be utilized to meet it."
"If funds cannot be provided by either of these methods, it will have to be considered whether the excess should be met by postponement of expenditure or whether an application for supplementary grant or appropriation should be made."
"(v)  The Supplementary Demand for Grants shall be presented to the Parliament in a number of batches as decided by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs."
"The first batch shall normally consist of requirements of the following nature :- (a) Cases where advances from Contingency Fund of India have been granted, which are required to be recouped to the Fund."
"(b) Payment against a court decree, which cannot be postponed; and (c) Cases of additional requirement of funds for making immediate payments, which can be met by re- appropriation of savings in the Grant but attract the limitation of New Service / New Instrument of Service."
(vi) All applications for supplementary grants or appropriations should be submitted by the Department of the Central Government administratively concerned to the Ministry of Finance on such dates and in such forms / batches as may be prescribed by the latter from time to time.
"(vii)On receipt of an application for a supplementary grant, the Ministry of Finance will review the position of the grant of appropriation as a whole with reference to the known actuals of the year to date and the actuals and estimates for previous years."
"If after this examination, the Ministry of Finance comes to the conclusion that it should be possible for the Administrative Department to meet the expenditure from within the sanctioned grant either from normal savings or by special economies or in the last resort by judicious postponement of other expenditure or in the last resort by judicious postponement of other expenditure, the Administrative Department will be so informed and no supplementary demand will be presented to Parliament."
"If, on the other hand, the Ministry of Finance considers that a supplementary grant will be necessary, a demand will be placed before Parliament."
Ministry of Finance Department of Expenditure
116 (viii)If during the course of the year it is found necessary to incur expenditure on a ‘New Service’ not provided for in the annual budget the Administrative Department shall explain to the Ministry of Finance why the expenditure was not provided for in the original budget and why it cannot be postponed for consideration in connection with the next budget.
"The Ministry of Finance, if satisfied on these points, will consider whether it would not be reasonable to ask the department concerned to curtail its other expenditure so as to keep the total within the grant."
"Ordinarily, no “new service” or item will be accepted by the Ministry of Finance, unless the department concerned can guarantee that the extra expenditure will be met from normal savings or by special economies within the grant."
Cases which involve additional grant will normally be accepted by the Ministry of Finance only if they relate to matters of real imperative necessity or to the earning or safeguarding of revenue.
The demand for a supplementary grant of appropriation or a token vote in respect of a “new service” will be presented to Parliament as soon as practicable after the need arises.

"In the case of records other than files, e.g., registers, the prescribed retention period will be counted from the year in which it has ceased to be current."
"In exceptional cases, a record may be retained for a period longer than that specified in the schedule, if it has certain special features or such a course is warranted by the peculiar needs of the department."
"In no case, however, will a record be retained for a period shorter than that prescribed in the schedule."

143 Note – The principle to be adopted in respect of files having financial implications and hence liable to be called by audit for inspection is that such files should be retained for a period of five years after they have been recorded.
"If, at any time during the period of five years, an audit objection having reference to the transaction dealt with in that file arises, is received, the file will not be destroyed until after the audit objection has been settled to the satisfaction of the audit."
"Also, if local audit does not take place within the period of five years, the Head of the Office should ascertain from the audit authorities whether they have any objection to the files relating to the earlier years, due for weeding out by the application of the five year formula, being destroyed or retained for a further period for scrutiny by the audit party and, if so, for what period."
"While records may be reviewed and weeded out at periodical intervals in the light of the retention periods prescribed to avoid their build-up, the attempt should be to make a continuous and conscious effort throughout the year to weed out unnecessary records."
"The retention period specified in Column (4) in the case of a file, is to be reckoned from the year in which the file is closed (i.e., action thereon has been completed) and not necessarily from the year in which it is recorded."
"In the case of records other than files, e.g., registers, the prescribed retention period will be counted from the year in which it has ceased to be current."
"In exceptional cases, a record may be retained for a period longer than that specified in the Schedule, if it has certain special features or such a course is warranted by the peculiar needs of the Department."
"In no case, however, will a record be retained for a period shorter than that prescribed in the schedule."
"If a record is required in connection with the disposal of another record, the former will not be weeded out until after all the issues raised on the latter have been finally decided, even though the retention period marked on the former may have expired in the meantime."

The pre-check to be applied to all payments by the departmentalized Accounts Officers includes a check against provision of funds also.
It is an important part of the functions of the Accounts Office to see that no payment is made in excess of the budget allotment.
"In order to exercise an effective check in this behalf, a separate register (DDO- wise Bill Passing-cum-Expenditure Control Register –Form CAM –9) should be maintained in the Accounts Officer for each Drawing Officer and by sub-heads and units of appropriation so as to ensure at the time of passing each bill that the amount of the bill under check is covered by Budget allotment."
"If the amount of any bill leads to excess over the Budget allotment or is not covered by an advance from the Contingency Fund, the Accounts Officer should decline payment  under advice to the authority controlling the grant so that the latter could arrange for additional funds."
"– In cases where payment of a bill/claim would lead to excess over the provision under any unit of appropriation the payment may be made by the Pay and Accounts Office only on receipt of an assurance in writing from the Ministry/Head of Department controlling the grant that the expenditure involved is not on a New Service, or New Instrument of Service; that necessary funds to accommodate the expenditure will be provided for in time by issue of re- appropriation order, etc., that a note to the effect has been kept for further action, and that the grant as a whole (i.e., separately under Revenue and Capital Sections) is not likely to be exceeded."
"This applies in respect of any new item of expenditure, provision for which does not exist in the Budget (as distinct from expenditure on “New Service” or “New Instrument Service” not provided in the Budget) as well as in cases where the existing provisions is not sufficient to cover the payments."
"In case of an urgent requirement of expenditure attracting the provisions of New Service/New Instruments of Service and thereby supplementary demands through the approval of Parliament, the same should be referred to Ministry of Finance."
The excess expenditure in such cases can be allowed by the concerned Financial Advisers only on the specific approval of Secretary (Expenditure) that the necessary funds will be made available through the next batch of supplementary demands for grant.
"If such a contingency in regard to inevitable payment of a bill should arise towards the close of financial year and the grant as a whole is likely to get exceeded thereby, order of the FA on behalf of the Chief Accounting Authority would have to be sought."
"In case the additional funds required are to be made available merely by reallocation (and not by re- appropriation) of savings, if any, under the same sub-head of appropriation, the related claim will be passed for payment only after additional funds therefor are allocated in writing by the Controlling Officer."

"[ See Rule 225 (viii) (b) ] The formula for Price Variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a material element and a labour element."
"The figures representing the material element and the labour element should reflect the corresponding proportion of input costs, while the fixed element may range from 10 to 25%."
That portion of the price represented by the fixed element will not be subject to variation.
The portions of the price represented by the material element and labour element alone will attract Price variation.
The formula for Price variation will thus be : Where P1 is the adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus figure will indicate a reduction in the Contract Price) P0 is the Contract Price at the base level.
a is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract price.
b is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price.
L0 and L1 are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the month and year of calculation respectively.
M0 and M1 are the material indices at the base month and year and at the month and year of calculation respectively.
"If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element can be broken up into two or three components such as Mx, My &Mz."
"Where price variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant inputs of materials) as for example in getting Technical assistance normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the price variation formula should have only two elements viz."
"The fixed element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending on the mark-up by the supplier of the Periderm rate vis-à-vis the wage rates."
