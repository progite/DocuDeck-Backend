,"In order to allocate the available coal to thermal power plants all  over the country, a new policy guideline was introduced by Ministry of Coal on 22nd May 2017 namely Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India (referred as the “SHAKTI Policy”) with the objective of linking coal based on transparent and objective criteria for the optimal utilization of the natural resources."
,“Power requirement of group of States can also be aggregated and procurement of such aggregated power can be made by an agency designated by Ministry of Power or authorized by such States on the basis of tariff based bidding.
,"Coal linkages will be earmarked for such agencies by pre-declaring the availability of coal linkage with description, based on which such agency will undertake tariff based competitive bidding for long-term and medium-term procurement of power and recommend grant of these linkages to successful bidders."
,The methodology in this regard shall be formulated by Ministry of Power.” 1.3.
,"Subsequently, Ministry of Power issued an OM No L-2/2018-IPC (Part 4) dated 8.3.2019 on the subject “Approval of the Government on the recommendations of the Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted  to examine the specific recommendations of High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) constituted to address the issue of stressed thermal power projects” and  para 2.1 (C) of the said OM states that :"

,"For official use only MoP/MAPP/20.08.2015 viii Overview of the Model Agreement for Procurement of Power framework To meet the infrastructure deficit, the Twelfth Five Year Plan envisages a renewed thrust on investment in infrastructure, with greater participation from the private sector."
,"Of the projected investment in infrastructure, about 29 per cent is envisaged in the power sector, of which about 47 per cent is expected from the private sector."
,Bulk of the private investment in power sector will be in the generation segment.
,Power projects have been witnessing a significant interest from both domestic as well as foreign investors following the policy initiatives taken by the Government of India.
,"However, the actual inflow of investment has been slower than expected, and future prospects would depend significantly on adoption of a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework necessary for addressing the complexities of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), especially for balancing the interests of Utilities and investors."
,"To this end, a precise policy and regulatory framework is being spelt out in this Model Power Agreement for Procurement of Power (MAPP)."
,The framework contained in the MAPP addresses the issues which are important for producers who supply electricity to the Utilities through medium- term contracts.
,These issues include mitigation and unbundling of risks; allocation of risks and rewards; symmetry of obligations between the principal parties; precision and predictability of costs and obligations; reduction of transaction costs; force majeure; and termination.
,"It also addresses other important concerns such as consumer protection, independent monitoring and dispute resolution."
,This MAPP provides the basis for optimal utilisation of resources on the one hand and adoption of international best practices on the other.
,The objective is to secure value for public money while providing reliable and cost effective electricity to the consumers.
,This MAPP is a base document to be used by procuring utilities for inviting bids from producers for supply of electricity over the medium term.
,The MAPP can be customised for base-load as well as peak hour procurement of electricity.
,"It is based on Finance, Own, and Operate (FOO) model."
,"Variations required for procurement of coal-based, gas-based and hydro-electric power stations have been provided within the MAPP."
,"Elements of financial viability The three critical elements that determine the financial viability of generation projects are the contract period, fuel costs and capital costs."
,The contract period for a generation project should be fixed keeping in view the requirement of power by the Utility.
,"It could be fixed between one and five years, with provision for extension of this period for the lower of 25% of the initial contract period and one year, with mutual consent."
,A comprehensive framework is a pre-requisite for PPP in electricity generation Need to reduce capital costs For official use only MoP/MAPP/20.08.2015 ix Fixed Charge The Utility shall pay to the Supplier a Fixed Charge determined through competitive bidding for availability of the Power Station.
,The Fixed Charge determined for each accounting year shall be revised annually to reflect 20 per cent of the variation in wholesale price index (WPI).
,"Since repayment of debt would be substantially neutral to inflation, the said indexation of 20 per cent is considered adequate."
,"A higher level of indexation is not favoured, as that would impose an unjustified burden on the consumers."
,Variable Charge Variable Charge is the amount payable by the Utility to the Supplier for the fuel utilised in generation of electricity.
,"Since the risk of variation in fuel price cannot normally be managed by the Supplier, it must be passed on to the Utility, which, in turn, will have to reflect it in the distribution tariff."
,"Since pass through of Variable Charge affords full protection to the Supplier against potential losses on account of a rise in fuel prices, it follows that the benefit of reduced fuel prices cannot be retained by the Supplier."
,"As a result, Variable Charge cannot be a profit centre for the Supplier and the principles for determination of Variable Charge must ensure that costs are recovered on the basis of actuals, assuming that the Supplier would function with the efficiency expected of a prudent and diligent operator."
,The framework contained in the MAPP provides alternative formulations for determination of fuel costs depending on the source and pricing of fuel supplies.
,"Each category of supply is, therefore, covered through its respective formulation."
,"In case where fuel is to be procured from domestic market, the cost of fuel shall be linked to the monthly average of a Fuel Price Index as may be mutually agreed upon."
,"When imported fuel is to be used, reliance should be placed on pre-selected coal indices used widely in international supplies of coal, but always subject to the actual cost incurred by the Supplier."
,"For supply of electricity procured, the lump sum tariff option has been provided."
,Options for fuel imported under a fixed-price gas contract and for gas procured from ONGC/GAIL have also been stipulated with provisions for ‘take or pay’ supply of fuel.
,"However, if bids are invited from producers having captive mines abroad, the prevailing price could be prescribed with appropriate indexation over the supply period."
,"In all cases of imported fuel, the foreign exchange risk would have to be borne by the Utility as the Supplier would have no means to hedge such risk on a long-term basis."
,"Concessional Fuel Fuel which is procured by the Supplier through any form of concessional, preferential or captive allocation or sale by a Government Instrumentality shall be deemed as Concessional Fuel and shall not be used for production of electricity for supply under a medium term contract."
,"However, in case gas is supplied by ONGC/GAIL on concessional terms, it may be used for supply under a medium-term contract with approval of the Government."
,Fixed Charge to be competitive Variable Charge to be a pass through For official use only MoP/MAPP/20.08.2015 x
,Availability and Despatch of Power Station The Supplier shall operate the Power Station such that it is available for generation to the extent of 85 per cent of the Contracted Capacity which shall be deemed to be the Normative Availability for each accounting year.
,Any shortfall in the Normative Availability will attract damages.
,The Supplier shall declare the availability of the Power Station at frequent intervals and the Utility shall be free to direct the Supplier to produce and despatch electricity in accordance with the despatch instructions given by it from time to time.
,Payment of Fixed Charge shall be computed on the basis of availability of the Power Station while the Variable Charge shall be payable only for the electricity actually produced and despatched.
,"Normally, the Power Station shall be deemed as available to the full extent."
,"In the event of any defect or deficiency, the Supplier must declare the actual availability so that its Fixed Charge is computed accordingly."
,The MAPP stipulates stiff damages in case of mis-declaration by the Supplier.
,"Technical parameters Unlike the normal practice of focusing on construction specifications, the technical parameters proposed in the MAPP are based mainly on output specifications, as these have a direct bearing on the level of power generation."
,"Only the core requirements of operation have been specified, leaving enough room for the Supplier to innovate and add value."
,"In sum, the framework focuses on the ‘what’ rather than the ‘how’ in relation to the production and supply of power by the Supplier."
,This would also provide the requisite flexibility to the Supplier to innovate and optimise in a way normally denied under conventional input-based procurement specifications.
,Outcome orientation The efficiency of the Supplier would normally be reflected in the quality and reliability of power supply.
,"In particular, the Supplier shall be required to ensure the availability of Contracted Capacity at pre-determined normative levels."
,Selection of Supplier Selection of the Supplier will be based on a two-stage process of competitive bidding.
,"All project parameters such as the concession period, technical parameters and performance standards are to be clearly stated upfront."
,"Based on these terms, the short-listed bidders will be required to specify their financial offer in terms of a unit Fixed Charge, without any qualifications."
,"In some cases, the financial offer may also have to include the Variable Charge based on the landed cost of fuel."
,The bidder who seeks the lowest unit charge should win the contract.
,The financial offer for the unit charge shall be made only for the initial year and the actual tariff payable to the Supplier will be revised annually based on pre-determined indexation.
,Technical parameters for level of service Fixed Charge to be paid for Availability of Power Station Penalties for mis-declaration
,"Outcome orientation is the key Competitive bidding on Fixed Charge will be the norm For official use only MoP/MAPP/20.08.2015 xi Risk allocation As an underlying principle, risks have been allocated to the parties that are best suited to manage them."
,"Project risks have, therefore, been assigned to the private sector to the extent it is capable of managing them."
,These risks have also been mitigated to the extent possible.
,The transfer of these risks and responsibilities to the private sector would increase the scope of innovation leading to efficiencies in costs and services.
,"The commercial and technical risks relating to construction, operation and maintenance are being allocated to the Supplier, as it would be best suited to manage them."
,"On the other hand, all direct and indirect political risks are being assigned to the Utility."
,Conditions Precedent Procuring approval of the Appropriate Commission for payment of Tariff by the Utility to the Supplier has been proposed as condition precedent to be satisfied by the Utility.
,Access to the transmission system for carrying electricity from power station to delivery point and procurement of applicable permits have been proposed as conditions precedent to be satisfied by the supplier.
,The Utility would provide reasonable support and assistance to the Supplier in procuring the applicable permits.
,Damages have been prescribed for delay in fulfilling the conditions precedent by the Utility as well as the Supplier.
,Operation of the Power Station The Supplier is expected to demonstrate a high standard of operation and maintenance of the Power Station with a view to ensuring the requisite level of reliability and availability.
,Any violations would attract damages.
,"In sum, operational performance would be the most important test of service delivery as it would have a direct bearing on the supply of electricity to the Utility."
,Force majeure The MAPP contains the requisite provisions for dealing with force majeure events.
,"In particular, it affords protection to the Supplier against political actions that may have a material adverse effect on the project."
,"Termination In the event of termination, the MAPP provides for a calibrated termination payment by the Supplier or the Utility, as the case may be."
,Termination payments have been quantified precisely as compared to the complex formulations in most such agreements relating to infrastructure projects.
,Political force majeure and defaults by the Utility would qualify for adequate compensatory payments to the Supplier and will thus guard against any discriminatory or arbitrary action by the Utility.
,"Miscellaneous The MAPP addresses other important issues such as dispute resolution, suspension of rights, change in law, insurance, indemnity, and disclosure of An effective dispute resolution mechanism is critical Fulfilment of conditions precedent"
,Pre-determined termination payments should provide predictability
,Commercial risks to be borne by Supplier
,Risk allocation and mitigation are critical For official use only MoP/MAPP/20.08.2015 xii project documents.
,It incorporates the best practices that would enable a fair and transparent framework for private participation.
,"Conclusion Together with the Schedules, the proposed contractual framework addresses the issues that are likely to arise in operation of generation projects on FOO basis."
,"The proposed policy and regulatory framework contained in the MAPP is critical for attracting competitive supply of electricity with the concomitant efficiencies and lower costs, necessary for accelerating growth and making electricity affordable."

,"New Delhi, the 21st August 2023 Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from Grid Connected Wind Solar Hybrid Projects."
,BACKGROUND 1.1.
,"MNRE issued Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy on 14.05.2018 (and issued amendment on 13.08.2018) with the objective to provide a framework for promotion of large grid connected wind-solar PV hybrid system for optimal and efficient utilization of transmission infrastructure and land, reducing the variability in renewable power generation and achieving better grid stability."
,"Section 63 of Electricity Act, 2003 promotes competition in the electricity sector and provides for adoption of the tariff by the Appropriate Commission if the same has been determined through transparent process of 16"
,bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.
,The National Tariff Policy notified on 28 January 2016 also encourages the procurement of renewable power through competitive bidding to discover market-based tariff.
,"To promote competitive procurement of electricity from grid connected wind solar hybrid power projects (hereafter termed as 'Hybrid Power Project'), by distribution licensees, to protect consumer interests; b."
,"To facilitate renewable capacity addition and fulfilment of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) requirement of DISCOMs; c. To facilitate transparency and fairness in procurement processes / and to provide for a standardised framework for an Intermediary Procurer as an Aggregator/Trader for the inter-state sale-purchase of long-term power at competitive prices in consumer interest; and d. To provide a risk-sharing framework between various stakeholders and ensure reasonable returns to the investors involved in the wind solar hybrid power procurement, thereby encouraging further investments, enhanced bankability of the Projects and profitability for the investors."
,"These Guidelines are being issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for long- term procurement of electricity through competitive bidding process, by Procurer(s), from Hybrid Power Projects having (a) bid capacity of 10 MW and above for projects connected to intra-state transmission system; and (b) bid capacity of 50 MW and above for projects connected to inter-state transmission system, subject to the condition that the rated power capacity of one resource (wind or solar) shall be at least 33% of the total contracted capacity."
,The solar and wind projects of the hybrid project may be located at same or different locations.
,"Storage may be added to the hybrid power project: a. to reduce the variability of output power from wind solar hybrid project; b. providing higher energy output for a given capacity (bid/ sanctioned capacity) at delivery point, by installing additional capacity of wind and solar power in a wind solar hybrid project; c. to ensure availability of firm power for a particular period."
,"The provisions of these Guidelines shall be binding on the Procurer, Authorised Representative and Intermediary Procurer."
,The process to be adopted in event of any deviation proposed from these Guidelines is specified in Clause 19of these Guidelines.
,The power procured from the project may be used for fulfilment of RPO in the proportion of rated capacity of solar and wind power in the plant respectively.
,"Principles outlined in these Guidelines may be suitably detailed in the Standard Bidding Documents [consisting of Model Request for Selection (RfS) Document, Model Power Purchase Agreement and Model Power Sale Agreement]."
,"Upon notification of these Guidelines in the Official Gazette, the erstwhile Guidelines notified vide No."
,"However, the projects already awarded/ under implementation/ commissioned under the erstwhile Bidding Guidelines, will continue to be governed by those Guidelines and will not be covered under these Guidelines."
,"In case there are any ongoing bids wherein the last date of bid submission is after the date of notification of these Guidelines, then the bid documents in respect of such bids shall be appropriately modified to bring them in alignment with these Guidelines."
,"a. Procurer(s): The term 'Procurer(s)', as the context may require, shall mean the distribution licensee(s), or their Authorized Representative, or an Intermediary procurer."
,"Authorized Representative of the Procurer(s): In cases, where the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signing agency and the agency carrying out the tendering / bidding process are different, the agency carrying out the tendering / bidding process shall be deemed to be the Authorized Representative of the ‘Procurer’ and shall, on behalf of the Procurer, be responsible for fulfilling all the obligations imposed on the ‘Procurer’ during the bidding phase, in accordance with these Guidelines."
,"In some cases, an intermediary, as designated by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, or a State Government, may be tasked to aggregate the power purchased from different generators and sell it to the distribution licensee(s) / consuming entities / open access consumers."
,"In such cases, the distribution licensee(s) / consuming entities / open access consumers shall be the “End Procurer” and the intermediary shall be ”Intermediary Procurer” for the purposes of these Guidelines."
,The Intermediary Procurer shall enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Hybrid Power Generator(s) and also enter into a Power Sale Agreement (PSA) with the End Procurer.
,The PSA shall contain the relevant provisions of the PPA on a back-to-back basis.
,0.07 / kWh shall be payable by the End Procurer to the Intermediary Procurer.
,"As long as the Intermediary Procurer follows these Guidelines for procurement of hybrid power, the End Procurer shall be deemed to have followed these Guidelines for procurement of hybrid power."
,"d. ‘Hybrid Power Generator (HPG)/ Generator’: The term ‘Hybrid Power Generator/ Generator’, wherever used in these Guidelines, shall refer to a generator and supplier of electricity generated through a Wind Solar Hybrid power generating station."
,e. Scheduled Commencement of Supply Date (SCSD): Scheduled Commencement of Supply Date (SCSD) in relation to the contracted capacity or the part of the contracted capacity shall mean the date(s) corresponding to the date of commencement of supply quoted in the RfS (Request for Selection).
,The Procurer shall meet the following conditions: 5.1.
,Bid Documentation: a) The Procurer shall prepare the bid documents in accordance with these Guidelines.
,"Any deviations from these Guidelines and/or Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) in the draft RfS, draft PPA, draft PSA (if applicable) need to be approved by the Government in accordance with the process described in Clause 19 of these Guidelines."
,"However, if the Procurer while preparing the draft RfS, draft PPA, draft PSA and other Project agreements provides detailed provisions that are consistent with the Guidelines, such detailing will not be considered as deviations from these Guidelines."
,"Arrangements related to Commencement of Supply: The RfS may specify additional milestones for the project with respect to land acquisition, connectivity etc."
,"Obtaining all clearances, permits, licenses including arrangement of land and connectivity to the Grid and access (if applicable) prior to scheduled date of commencement of supply of power shall be the responsibility of the HPG and the Procurer shall not be responsible in case of delay in obtaining such clearances, permits, licenses etc."
,Bid Size: The Procurer will invite the bids in Power Capacity (MW) terms.
,A bidder is allowed to bid for a minimum bid capacity as per Clause 3.1 of the Guidelines.
,The Procurer may also choose to specify the maximum capacity that can be allotted to a single bidder including its Affiliates1.3 6.2.
,"For procurement of wind solar hybrid power, the tariff quoted by the bidder shall be the bidding parameter."
,The tariff quoted shall be fixed tariff in Rs./kWh for PPA period.
,"The capacity allocation shall be on the basis of Bucket filling i.e. capacity quoted by least quoted tariff bidder (called the L1 bidder) at the rates quoted (L1 rates) shall be allocated first, then the capacity quoted by the next lowest bidder (called the L2 bidder) at the rates quoted (called the L2 rates) may be allocated and so on."
,"31Affiliate in relation to a Company shall mean a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under the commoncontrol with such Company."
,"The expression ‘control’ shall mean the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting shares of such Company or right to appoint majority Directors."
,"However, the allocation will only be made to the bidders whose bid falls within a pre-defined “Range” from the L1 tariff, as stipulated in the RfS."
,"Thus, after arranging the bidders in the ascending order of tariff, the Project capacities will be awarded only to those bidders whose final price bids are within a range of “L1+x%”, in terms of Rs/kWh; while the value of “x” generally be two (2) to five (5) and shall be fixed in the RfS.” 6.2.3."
,"The procurer may also opt for reverse auction for final selection of bidders, in such a case, this will be specifically mentioned in the notice inviting bids and bid document."
,"The procurer may disclose in the RfS, the prevailing incentives available to the HPGs."
,A maximum of 50 percent of total capacity as specified in RfScan be allocated to a single bidder.
,The draft PPA proposed to be entered into with the successful bidder and draft PSA shall be issued along with the RfS.
,"Standard provisions to be incorporated as part of the PPA shall include inter alia the following, which, unless otherwise specified herein, shall be provided for, on a back-to-back basis in the PSA: 7.1."
,PPA Period: The PPA period shall generally be for a period of 20 (twenty) years from the date of the SCSD or from the rescheduled date of commencement of supply to the extent of extension given by the Procurer on the grounds which are beyond control of the HPG.
,"The PPA may, however, also be fixed for a longer period such as 25 (twenty-five) years.The duration of the PPA must be mentioned upfront in the RfS document."
,The developers shall be free to operate their plants after the expiry of the PPA period.
,The developer may upgrade and repower their plants during the PPA period at its own risk and cost; and participate in subsequent bids to the extent of their untied capacity.
,Developers who have already installed wind solar hybrid power plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate in the bid.

,"New Delhi, the 9th June, 2023 Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Firm and Dispatchable Power from Grid Connected Renewable Energy Power Projects with Energy Storage Systems No."
,23/03/2023-R&R 1.
,Background 1.1.1.
,"In order to facilitate development of grid connected solar power, the first phase of National Solar Mission provided for a scheme of “bundling” wherein, the then relatively expensive solar power was bundled with cheaper thermal power from the unallocated quota of the Government of India (Ministry of Power), generated by NTPC coal-based stations."
,"With the intervention of Government of India, the risks associated with solar and wind power sector have been brought down through measures as advance arrangement of land and evacuation through solar parks, green energy corridors, a secure and standardized Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 25 years with elaborate mechanism for risk apportionment and compensations, payment security, etc."
,"Such de-risking of renewable energy (RE) sector, coupled with advancement of technologies and economies of scale has resulted in bringing down the tariffs in solar and wind power sector thereby aiding in rapid deployment of solar and wind capacity in the country."
,"However, the intermittent and variable nature of renewable energy and low-capacity utilization of the transmission system needs to be addressed."
,The problem will get pronounced with the addition of large- scale renewable capacity.
,"In order to manage the infirm nature of power, electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) are procuring balancing power to provide grid stability and meeting their requirements during hours /periods of non-availability of renewable energy (RE)."
,"The developments in renewable energy sector, an increased demand for ‘green power’ and a vision for realising ‘true’ energy independence for the country, present a case for supply of round-the- 16"
,The objective is to cater to the off-taker’s requirements based on demand completely from RE sources.
,"Section 61 & 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003, provide for tariff regulation and determination of tariff of generation, transmission, wheeling and retail sale of electricity by the Appropriate Commission."
,"“Notwithstanding anything contained in section 62, the Appropriate Commission shall adopt the tariff if such tariff has been determined through transparent process of bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government."""
,"Promotion of competition in the electricity industry in India is one of the key objectives of the Electricity Act, 2003 (‘Act’).Power purchase costs constitute the largest cost element for distribution licensees."
,Competitive procurement of electricity by the distribution licensees is expected to reduce the overall cost of procurement of power and facilitate development of power markets.
,"These Guidelines are being issued under section 63 of the Act to enable procurement of Firm and Dispatchable RE power by DISCOMs from grid-connected Renewable Energy (RE) power projects, with Energy Storage through tariff based competitive bidding."
,Firm and Dispatchable RE power means supply of electricity as per the demand profile specified in the RfS/ bidding documents.
,To provide firm and dispatchable power to the DISCOMs from renewable energy sources; (b).
,To facilitate renewable capacity addition and fulfilment of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO)/ Storage Power obligations (SPO)requirement of DISCOMs; (c).
,"To provide a transparent, fair, standardized procurement framework based on open competitive bidding with appropriate risk-sharing between various stakeholders to enable procurement of power at competitive prices in consumer interest, improve bankability of projects and ensure reasonable returns to the investors; and (d)."
,"To provide for a framework for the inter-state/ intra-state, long-term, sale-purchase of power as a further measure to derisk the sector."
,"Applicability of Guidelines These Guidelines are being issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for long term procurement of firm and dispatchable power by the ‘Procurers’, from Renewable (RE) Power Projects (‘RE Projects’), through competitive bidding."

,(d).
,"The term RE Power Generator‘(RE-PG) or Generator‘, wherever used in these Guidelines, shall refer to a generator and supplier of firm and Dispatchable RE Power with energy storage system, which include RTC RE power Projects capable of supplying energy round the clock as per"
,"The bidder/developer shall be responsible for providing renewable energy resource based generating system(s) including solar, wind or any other renewable resource as defined by MNRE for supply of RE Power combined with storage."
,"For this, the bidder/developer shall have either set up storage capacity itself; or tie up with energy storage system developers to meet the project parameters for ‘firmness and dispatchability’, and submit a single bid for the same, in a particular tender."
,"Irrespective of the contractual arrangement between the RE Power Generator and Energy Storage system Developer, if any, all the developer related liabilities, under these Guidelines and the PPA there under, shall be of the entity signing the PPA, and recognised as RE Power Generator‘"
,(e).
,"‘RE Park’: The term ‘RE Park’, wherever used in these Guidelines, shall refer to areas or parks developed, in accordance with the Guidelines issued by Central or State Governments, for setting-up of renewable energy power projects, including Solar-Wind Hybrid Power projects."
